# Agent Instructions: Using Upstash MCP Server for Development Assistance

## Overview

You are an AI development assistant with access to an Upstash Vector database containing Go development documentation, recipes, and best practices. This database has been populated with intelligent chunks of development resources to help you provide accurate, context-aware assistance for new Go projects.

## Your Primary Mission

1. **Initial Setup**: Learn the available data and MCP capabilities
2. **Project Integration**: Understand how to leverage this knowledge for new project development
3. **Custom Instructions**: Create your own project-specific instruction file

## Step 1: Explore the Available Data

### Understanding the Vector Database Content

The vector database contains:

- **Go Fiber Recipes**: Complete examples for web development with Fiber v2
- **Clean Architecture Patterns**: Implementation examples and best practices
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL, connection patterns, and ORMs
- **API Development**: REST APIs, OpenAPI/Swagger implementations
- **Template Systems**: HTML rendering and asset bundling
- **Deployment**: Vercel deployment configurations
- **Authentication**: Security patterns and middleware
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and mocking strategies

### Initial Exploration Queries

Start by exploring the available data using these natural language queries:

```
"What Go Fiber recipes are available for web development?"
"Show me clean architecture examples in Go"
"What database connection patterns are documented?"
"How do I implement authentication in Go Fiber?"
"What testing strategies are used in the examples?"
"Show me API development patterns with OpenAPI"
"What deployment configurations are available?"
```

### Analyze the Data Structure

Pay attention to:
- **Code Patterns**: Common architectural approaches
- **File Structures**: Project organization patterns
- **Dependencies**: Frequently used Go packages
- **Configuration**: Environment and setup patterns
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error management approaches

## Step 2: Master the MCP Server Capabilities

### Available Query Types

1. **Semantic Search**: Find relevant code by describing functionality
2. **Pattern Discovery**: Identify common implementation approaches
3. **Best Practices**: Find proven solutions and patterns
4. **Troubleshooting**: Locate solutions to common problems
5. **Integration Examples**: Find how different components work together

### Effective Query Strategies

**For Code Examples:**
- "Show me how to implement [feature] in Go Fiber"
- "What are the patterns for [concept] in the available code?"
- "Find examples of [specific pattern] with error handling"

**For Architecture:**
- "What clean architecture patterns are demonstrated?"
- "How do the examples structure their projects?"
- "What dependency injection patterns are used?"

**For Specific Technologies:**
- "Show me PostgreSQL integration examples"
- "How is authentication implemented across different projects?"
- "What testing frameworks and patterns are used?"

## Step 3: Create Project-Specific Instructions

After exploring the data, create your own instruction file that includes:

### 1. Project Context
- Project type and requirements
- Technology stack preferences
- Specific constraints or requirements

### 2. Data Utilization Strategy
- Which parts of the vector database are most relevant
- How to adapt existing patterns to the new project
- Which examples to prioritize

### 3. Query Templates
Create specific query templates for your project:

```
# Template for [Feature] Implementation
"Show me Go Fiber examples for implementing [feature] with [specific requirements]"

# Template for Architecture Decisions
"What are the clean architecture patterns for [domain] in Go?"

# Template for Problem Solving
"How do the existing examples handle [specific problem] with [constraints]?"
```

### 4. Integration Guidelines
- How to modify existing patterns for project needs
- When to create new implementations vs. adapting existing ones
- How to maintain consistency with documented best practices

## Step 4: Development Workflow Integration

### When Starting New Features

1. **Query First**: Search for relevant existing implementations
2. **Analyze Patterns**: Understand the approaches used in successful examples
3. **Adapt and Customize**: Modify patterns to fit project requirements
4. **Validate**: Ensure the solution aligns with best practices in the database

### When Facing Problems

1. **Search for Solutions**: Look for similar problems in the documentation
2. **Study Approaches**: Understand how others solved similar issues
3. **Apply Patterns**: Use proven solutions as a foundation
4. **Document**: Note the solution for future reference

### When Making Architecture Decisions

1. **Research Patterns**: Find established architectural approaches
2. **Compare Options**: Evaluate different implementation strategies
3. **Consider Trade-offs**: Use documented examples to understand pros/cons
4. **Justify Choices**: Base decisions on proven patterns from the database

## Step 5: Continuous Learning

### Update Your Knowledge

- Regularly query for new patterns and approaches
- Learn from the evolution of code in different examples
- Identify emerging best practices across multiple projects

### Improve Query Effectiveness

- Refine queries based on results quality
- Develop domain-specific query patterns
- Build a mental map of available resources

## Creating Your Custom Instruction File

When you're ready to create your project-specific instruction file, include:

```markdown
# [Project Name] - Development Instructions

## Project Overview
[Brief description of project goals and requirements]

## Relevant Data Sources
[Which parts of the vector database are most relevant]

## Query Templates
[Project-specific query templates]

## Adaptation Guidelines
[How to modify existing patterns for this project]

## Development Workflow
[Step-by-step process for using the MCP server in this context]
```

## Best Practices for MCP Usage

1. **Be Specific**: Use detailed, context-rich queries
2. **Iterate**: Refine queries based on initial results
3. **Cross-Reference**: Compare multiple examples for comprehensive understanding
4. **Validate**: Always verify that patterns apply to your specific context
5. **Document**: Keep track of successful query patterns and solutions

## Example Workflow

```
1. User: "I need to implement user authentication"
2. Agent: "Let me search for authentication patterns in the Go Fiber examples..."
3. MCP Query: "Show me authentication implementations in Go Fiber with JWT"
4. Results: [Relevant code examples and patterns]
5. Agent: "Based on the examples, here are three approaches you can use..."
6. Adaptation: Modify the chosen pattern for the specific project needs
```

## Next Steps

1. **Start Exploring**: Begin with the suggested exploration queries
2. **Take Notes**: Document what you find and how it applies to development
3. **Create Templates**: Develop query patterns for your specific needs
4. **Build Instructions**: Create your project-specific instruction file
5. **Test and Refine**: Validate your approach with real development tasks

Your goal is to become an expert in leveraging this knowledge base to accelerate development, ensure best practices, and provide consistently high-quality assistance for Go projects.
