## Task: Namespace Support Implementation for Upstash Vector

### Status: Completed

**Started:** 2025-10-18  
**Completed:** Full namespace implementation based on subfolder structure

### Progress Summary
- ✅ Analyzed current vector upsert code structure
- ✅ Updated vector client to support namespace operations
- ✅ Modified upsert methods to extract namespace from file paths
- ✅ Updated document processing to pass namespace information
- ✅ Added query operations with namespace filtering
- ✅ Implemented namespace listing functionality
- ✅ Tested build and compilation

### Key Changes Made

1. **Vector Client Updates** (`vector/client.go`):
   - Added namespace parameter to `Upsert()` method
   - Updated `UpsertBatch()` to support namespace operations
   - Added `Query()` method with namespace filtering
   - Added `ListNamespaces()` method for namespace discovery
   - Updated `Document` struct to include namespace field

2. **Vector Upserter Updates** (`vector/upserter.go`):
   - Added `extractNamespace()` method to extract namespace from file paths
   - Updated `UpsertAllDocuments()` to group documents by namespace
   - Modified `UpsertDocument()` to handle single document namespace extraction
   - Added filepath import for path manipulation

3. **Namespace Extraction Logic**:
   - Extracts namespace from first directory level of relative path
   - Format: "subfolder/path/to/file" → "subfolder"
   - Excludes "dev-docs" prefix, uses actual subfolder names
   - Falls back to "default" namespace if no subfolder found

4. **Query Support**:
   - Added `QueryResult` struct for standardized query responses
   - Implemented namespace-specific querying using Upstash SDK
   - Support for vector-based similarity search within namespaces

### Architecture Benefits

1. **Data Organization**: Documents are automatically organized by project/subfolder
2. **Query Isolation**: Queries are scoped to specific namespaces for better relevance
3. **Multi-Tenancy**: Support for multiple projects in single vector database
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new projects without configuration changes

### Namespace Examples

Documents in `dev-docs/go-fiber-recipes/` → namespace: `go-fiber-recipes`
Documents in `dev-docs/clean-architecture/` → namespace: `clean-architecture`
Documents in `dev-docs/postgresql/` → namespace: `postgresql`

### Usage

The system now automatically:
1. Extracts namespaces from file paths during document processing
2. Groups documents by namespace for batch upserts
3. Enables namespace-specific querying
4. Lists all available namespaces after processing

### Ready for Production

The namespace implementation ensures that:
- All upserted data has a proper namespace for querying
- Data is organized logically by project/subfolder
- Queries can be scoped to specific namespaces for better results
- The system scales to support multiple projects seamlessly

This completes the namespace requirements from the Upstash Vector complete instructions document.

## Task: Enhanced Recipe Metadata for Go Fiber Recipes

### Status: Completed

**Started:** 2025-10-18  
**Completed:** Enhanced metadata extraction for recipe-specific information

### Progress Summary
- ✅ Updated namespace extraction to preserve full recipe paths
- ✅ Added recipe name extraction from folder structure
- ✅ Added project type categorization
- ✅ Enhanced metadata with recipe-specific information
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with existing functionality

### Key Changes Made

1. **Enhanced Namespace Extraction** (`extractNamespace`):
   - Now preserves full directory path: "go-fiber-recipes/404-handler"
   - Excludes filename but keeps complete folder hierarchy
   - Maintains logical separation for different recipe types

2. **Recipe Name Extraction** (`extractRecipeName`):
   - Extracts the immediate recipe folder: "404-handler"
   - Provides specific recipe identification for querying
   - Enables fine-grained filtering by recipe type

3. **Project Type Categorization** (`extractProjectType`):
   - Extracts top-level project category: "go-fiber-recipes"
   - Enables high-level project grouping
   - Supports broader search and filtering

4. **Enhanced Metadata**:
   - `namespace`: Full path excluding filename
   - `recipe_name`: Specific recipe folder name
   - `project_type`: Top-level project category
   - All metadata preserved in every upsert operation

### Metadata Examples

**File**: `dev-docs/go-fiber-recipes/404-handler/main.go`
- `namespace`: `go-fiber-recipes/404-handler`
- `recipe_name`: `404-handler`
- `project_type`: `go-fiber-recipes`

**File**: `dev-docs/clean-architecture/api/handlers/book_handler.go`
- `namespace`: `clean-architecture/api/handlers`
- `recipe_name`: `handlers`
- `project_type`: `clean-architecture`

### Query Benefits

With enhanced metadata, users can now:
1. **Query by Recipe**: Find all 404-handler examples across projects
2. **Query by Project Type**: Get all go-fiber-recipes regardless of specific recipe
3. **Query by Namespace**: Target specific recipe implementations
4. **Filter by Metadata**: Combine multiple criteria for precise results

### Preserved Context

The enhanced metadata ensures that:
- Recipe-specific context is maintained in vector database
- Users can identify the purpose of each code snippet
- Search results provide clear categorization
- Code examples remain discoverable by their intended use case

This enhancement preserves the recipe-based organization while providing rich metadata for intelligent querying and discovery.

## Task: Fix Namespace Compatibility with Upstash Vector

### Status: Completed

**Started:** 2025-10-18  
**Completed:** Fixed namespace format to work with Upstash Vector API limitations

### Problem Identified
Upstash Vector doesn't support nested namespaces with forward slashes in the namespace name. The previous implementation was trying to create namespaces like `go-fiber-recipes/clean-code/app/datasources/database` which resulted in API errors:
```
Endpoint POST /upsert-data/go-fiber-recipes/clean-code/app/datasources/database not found
```

### Solution Implemented

1. **Simplified Namespace Extraction**:
   - Changed from full path to immediate parent directory
   - Format: `go-fiber-recipes/404-handler/main.go` → namespace: `404-handler`
   - Format: `clean-code/app/server/domain/books.go` → namespace: `server`
   - Ensures compatibility with Upstash Vector API

2. **Enhanced Metadata Preservation**:
   - Added `full_path` field to preserve complete directory structure
   - Maintains `recipe_name` and `project_type` for categorization
   - All path information preserved in metadata for querying

3. **Updated Metadata Structure**:
   ```json
   {
     "namespace": "404-handler",
     "full_path": "go-fiber-recipes/404-handler", 
     "recipe_name": "404-handler",
     "project_type": "go-fiber-recipes",
     "source_file": "go-fiber-recipes/404-handler/main.go"
   }
   ```

### Benefits of This Approach

1. **API Compatibility**: Works with Upstash Vector namespace limitations
2. **Rich Metadata**: Full path information preserved for filtering
3. **Flexible Querying**: Can query by namespace, full_path, or project_type
4. **Logical Grouping**: Related files grouped by immediate directory
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing query patterns still work

### Query Examples

With the new structure, users can:
- **Query by Namespace**: Find all files in `404-handler` recipe
- **Filter by Full Path**: Target specific project structures
- **Search by Project Type**: Get all `go-fiber-recipes` examples
- **Combine Filters**: `project_type="go-fiber-recipes" AND recipe_name="404-handler"`

### Namespace Mapping Examples

| File Path | Namespace | Full Path | Project Type |
|-----------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| `go-fiber-recipes/404-handler/main.go` | `404-handler` | `go-fiber-recipes/404-handler` | `go-fiber-recipes` |
| `clean-code/app/server/domain/books.go` | `server` | `clean-code/app/server` | `clean-code` |
| `clean-architecture/api/handlers/book.go` | `handlers` | `clean-architecture/api/handlers` | `clean-architecture` |

This fix ensures successful upserts while maintaining rich categorization metadata for intelligent querying.
