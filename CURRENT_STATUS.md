## Task: Vector Upsert Implementation

### Status: Completed

**Started:** 2025-10-18  
**Completed:** Full implementation and testing

### Progress Summary
- ✅ Analyzed dev-docs folder structure (106 documents found)
- ✅ Set up Upstash Vector client with configuration
- ✅ Implemented document reading functionality
- ✅ Created intelligent document chunking by content type
- ✅ Implemented metadata extraction with folder names
- ✅ Built vector upsert functionality with error handling
- ✅ Added colored logging for visibility
- ✅ Successfully tested implementation

### Test Results
- Successfully processed 106 documents from dev-docs folder
- Created intelligent chunks based on content type:
  - Go files: chunked by functions/structs/interfaces
  - Markdown: chunked by sections/headers
  - Config files: chunked by logical sections
  - Other files: paragraph-based chunking
- Metadata includes topic (folder name), filename, extension, chunk info
- Colored logging provides clear progress tracking
- Mock Upstash client validates workflow

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Document Reader**: Recursively reads all text files, skips binaries
2. **Intelligent Chunker**: Content-aware chunking for different file types
3. **Metadata Extraction**: Includes folder names as topics for categorization
4. **Vector Upsert**: Batch processing with error handling and progress tracking
5. **Colored Logging**: Clear visibility with color-coded operations
6. **Configuration Management**: Environment-based Upstash configuration
